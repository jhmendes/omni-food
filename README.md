This website is from the Udemy course called "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3" by Jonas Schmedtmann (https://www.udemy.com/share/10002sAkofdV9VR3Q=/).  This was an excellent course from start to finish, focusing on the entire process of building a site from scratch.  I learned a great deal about planning site layout and content.  

The original course did not include any build tool or SCSS so after the course was finished I went back and setup a gulpfile and broke out my CSS into Sass partials.  This is my preferred method to work on sites as its much easier to maintain styles and architecture.  

After the main site was finished, we spent some time on actually launching the website live, covering performance optimization, basic SEO, FTP protocols, and Google analytics.

I highly recommend this course for anyone looking for a refresher and/or an excellent overview of building a website from start to finish.
